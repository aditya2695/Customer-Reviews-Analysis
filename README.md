# Customer-Reviews-Analysis

### Introduction
<p>

In this project, we propose to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic modeling and sentiment analysis to gain insights from customer reviews of an airline. Airline customer reviews provide valuable feedback on various aspects of the customer's experience, such as the quality of service, comfort, and punctuality. However, these reviews can be unstructured and difficult to analyze manually. By applying LDA-based topic modeling, we aim to identify key themes and topics in the reviews and understand the overall sentiment of the customers towards the airline. By combining topic modeling with sentiment analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of customer perceptions and identify areas where the airline can improve. This project will provide valuable insights for the airline to enhance the customer experience and improve their reputation in the market.
